## What is Quantumkit?

Quantumkit is a VS Code extension for HYBRID Software engineers. It strives for being the coding hub for eveything that needs to be scripted, provide snippets, functions and helpers for daily coding tasks and connects VS Code with Cloudflow and Packz using local preset files and the Cloudflow API.

This extension should close the gap between using our applications internal script editors and working with all of the modern development techniques like linting, code-formatting, syntax highlighting, versioning and converting. It allows you to use your very own customized VS Code IDE editor setup with all your preferred features and extensions while acting as a bridge between the editor and our company's applications.
